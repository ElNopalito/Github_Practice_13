    <h2>My Goals</h2>
<p class=p2">My goals have always been contingent on what my needs are at any given time. This is unfortunately un-sustainable and thus, I have chosen a more concrete and stable path. I have worked in many fields of labor and have yet to find a shoe that fits me well. Luckily, I found software development! I never was tech-orientd growing up and the most exposure I have comes from PC gaming. The friends I have made along the way are however tech savvy. When they speak about CPU, GPU, SSH, VPN, and other terms in tech venacular, I am often left out. Over time to keep up with their conversations, I grew a small interest in IT/Coding. I always thought coding was for those who were innately good at math which is a subject I am poor in. However, I learned some bit of coding for myself and learned that I really enjoyed fabricating something from scratch!</p>
<p>These past few days were certainly challenging learning about HTML and CSS. Nonethless, it was still fun! This is what I listen to while working(mindlessly droning code can be monotonous in silence)</p>
